# Modeling the Impact of Factors on Housing Prices in Qianzhen District, Kaohsiung

**1.	Introduction**
In recent years, housing prices in Taiwan have experienced a rapid and sustained increase, prompting widespread concerns regarding housing affordability and the sustainability of urban development. According to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), the national housing price index has shown a consistent upward trend since 2017, driven by factors such as persistently low interest rates, speculative investment in real estate, and urban population concentration (MOI, 2024). These developments have disproportionately affected younger and middle-income households, who increasingly find homeownership to be out of reach.
Among the cities undergoing notable transformation, Kaohsiung stands out for its rapid urban redevelopment. In particular, the Qianzhen District has transitioned from a primarily industrial zone into a mixed-use area combining residential, commercial, and public infrastructure. The establishment of transportation facilities such as Light Rail Transit has altered the landscape of the district, potentially reshaping the determinants of housing prices.
This study focuses on identifying the key drivers of housing prices in Qianzhen District by analyzing actual transaction data from 2017 to 2024. Using a multiple linear regression model, we examine the influence of property attributes such as building area, land area, number of rooms, age of the house, and the presence of parking or property management services. The goal is to provide a data-driven assessment of which factors significantly affect the unit price per square meter. The findings are expected to offer practical implications for urban policy, real estate development, and investment decision-making.
